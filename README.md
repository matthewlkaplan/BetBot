# BetBot
A project I undertook to build a bot to identify and exploit arbitrage opportunities in the sports betting market.

Arbitrage opportunities arise when there is a discrepancy between odds on the same event from two different bookmakers. A smart better can place bets on all outcomes of the event with different bookmakers at odds that guarantee a profit no matter the outcome.
